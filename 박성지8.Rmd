## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#4- 1-2
dbinom(1,2,1/2)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
#4- 1-3
sample(1:6, 1)

```

```{r}
#4- 1-4
sample(1:6, 1)
n = 6
p = 1/6
dbinom(1, 6, p)
```

```{r}
# 4-2
n = 10
p = 4/5

dbinom(7,10,0.8)
```


```{r}

# 4-3

n = 20
p = 0.05

pbinom(2,20,p)

```

```{r}
#4-4
n = 20
p = 0.2

pbinom(1,20,0.2)
1-pbinom(1,20,0.2)
```

```{r}
# 4-5

n =12
p= 5/36

dbinom(1,12,5/36)

```

```{r}
# 5-1
n=800
p=40
x=750
pnorm(750, 800, 40)

```

```{r}
# 5-2
n=  c (11:16,5)
p=20
p=0.1

1 - pnorm(20,11,5)
```

```{r}
#5-4
n=70
p=8

pnorm(90,70,8)
pnorm(90,70,8) - pnorm(80,70,8)

pnorm(3,1.5,2)
```


```{r}
#5-4

n=1.5
p=2
x=1 & 3
pnorm(3,1.5,2)
```
